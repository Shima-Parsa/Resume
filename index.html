        <h3>Research Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tissue Engineering</strong> (2021-present)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During 3 years at the regenerative medicine lab, I developed liver microtissues with a natural human liver cell ratio used to explore the effects of nanoparticles, human Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hWJ-MSC) exosomes, and Nicotinamide on fatty liver disease. Additionally, I investigated decellularization techniques for liver and cartilage tissues, aiming to minimize damage to the extracellular matrix. So far, this work suggests 3D-printed artificial cartilage with type I collagen, potentially aided by natural anti-inflammatory agents like Boswellic acid, could be a future alternative for cartilage implants.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cell Therapy</strong> (2021-present)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Utilized mesenchymal stem cells and stem cell-derived exosomes to develop therapeutic approaches for liver and cartilage regeneration, with a focus on optimizing cell-based repair and regeneration techniques.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis</strong> (2019-present)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Designed and managed research investigation of pathogens associated with human morbidity and mortality and potential therapeutic approaches in mitigating diverse stressors, including metabolic disorders and physical and chemical stress factors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conducting Surveys</strong> (2021-2023)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In two international projects, I developed an online survey that asked the participants whether they contracted COVID-19, their symptoms, time to recover, vaccination stage, and their frequency of eating various types of foods/beverages. The survey was developed in 10 different languages.</p>

        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Assistant</strong> (2020-present)</li>
            <li><strong>General Practitioner</strong> (2019-present)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Managing metabolic disorder cases and tissue engineering and applying autologous grafting for diabetic foot at Clean room and surgery wards at Hafez Hospital, a tertiary healthcare center in southern Iran, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.</p>
